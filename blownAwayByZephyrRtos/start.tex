\chapter{Getting Ready}

This chapter shows you the first steps with \Zephyr RTOS. At the end you will have a working installation of the development environment as well as compiled a sample application and flashed this binary into the target system. The final target is a flashing LED on your board of choice. Get your feet on the ground!

\section{Getting Started with \Zephyr}\index{Getting Started with \Zephyr}


To install the \Zephyr environment, follow the \href{https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html}{Getting Started Guide}. It will guide you through the whole installation process of the \Zephyr source code as well the software development kit (SDK) (compiler, linker, etc.)
This will copy and install quite a bunch of files, code and tools onto your workstation. The installation will work on the following operating systems (for details have a look into the hints corner: \ref{hint0}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (the recommended one;-)
    \item Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and later
    \item Max OS/X
    \item Windows 10
\end{itemize}

For the first installation, it is recommended to use the proposed folders and tool versions. Once the installation is up and running, you can tweak it to your needs. 
For example, to install several versions of zephyr on the same development machine, you can clone the installation in separate directories. 
It is also possible to isolate the installation from each other by using docker containers.

% If you are bound to a (windows) company network, see the hints in the appendix.

A few coffees later, the environment is installed and ready for a little exercise and a basic build check. 

For productive firmware development, it is usually a good parctice to focus on a specific release rather than working with the development branch. This can be achieved with a simple command line option while running \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{west init}. Use the follwing \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{west} command instead of that one mentioed in the getting started recepie: 
\mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{west init --mr v3.3.0 ~/zephyrproject}. This will install the \Zephyr major release 3.3.0 and not the actual development branch.

Compile and build the \emph{blinky} sample for your board/machine of choise and flash it to your hardware.

% \begin{exercise}
% Compile and build the Hello World LED  (Blinky) sample for your board/machine and flash it to your hardware. 
% And yes, Lorenz, it is really amazing when a LED flashes, even if it does so on an eval board when you power it for the first time... 
% 
% You will find all samples in the folder  \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/} of your installation. You can try them out as you like and play around until your ears are wiggling (nice german 1:1 translation;-).

% Analyze the sources of the examples. In particular the configuration files.
