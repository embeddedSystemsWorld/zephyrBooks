\chapter{Getting Ready}

This chapter shows you the first steps with \Zephyr RTOS. At the end you will have a working installation of the development environment. You will have compiled a sample application and flashed into the target system. The final target is a flashing LED on your board of choice. 

\section{Getting Started with \Zephyr}\index{Getting Started with \Zephyr}


To install the \Zephyr environment, follow the \href{https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html}{Getting Started Guide}. This will copy and install quite a bunch of files, code and tools onto your workstation. The installation should work on the following operating systems (for details have a look into the hints corner: \ref{hint0}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (the recommended one;-)
    \item Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
    \item Max OS/X
    \item Windows 10
\end{itemize}

For the first installation, it is recommended to use the proposed folders and tool versions. Once the installation is up and running, you can tweak it to your needs. 


If you are bound to a (windows) company network, see the hints in the appendix. 

A few coffees later the environment is installed and ready for a little exercise and a basic check.

\subsection{Hello World}\index{Hello World}

\begin{exercise}
Compile and build the HelloWorld sample for your board/machine and flash it to your hardware. 
\end{exercise}

\input{start_ht1b.tex}
\input{start_ht1a.tex}


\subsection{Hello World LED}\index{Hello World LED}

\begin{exercise}
Compile and build the Hello World LED  (Blinky) sample for your board/machine and flash it to your hardware. 
And yes, Lorenz, it is really amazing when a LED flashes, even if it does so on an eval board when you power it for the first time... 

You will find all samples in the folder  \mintinline[breaklines]{bash}{~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/} of your installation. You can try them out as you like and play around until your ears are wiggling (nice german 1:1 translation;-). 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Analyze the sources of the examples. In particular the configuration files. 
\end{exercise}
